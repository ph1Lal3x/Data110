The graph x,y3 had a scatter plot with all data numbers being similar except for one, the outlier. The graph also had a postive regression line but was less steep than the x,y2 graph. The x,y4 graph also had an outlier but the scatter plot was trending downward which also reflected in the regression line becoming negative. Lastly the x4,y4 graph was unique in that all the data points were lined up vertically at x = 8 except for the outlier. But because of the outlier having a greater y value, the regression line became positive.\n",
